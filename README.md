# NoLinks
This extension removes any kind of web interaction elements, specially disabling links behaviour and appearence; facilitating a cleaner and more focus read of a website.
According to "The Shallows" by Nicholas Carr, hyperlink texts and other interactive elements are one of the main factors that disrupts reading. Reading online activates different brain regions than book reading, and this is partly due to websites been saturated with interactive elements that impose unconscius decissions regarding clicking them or not.

 In order to mitigate this, this addon removes any interaction in the web displayed in tab (such as pointer events) and it presents links as plain text, improving readability. Moreover, this addon may launch when possible , the integrated Firefox reader view to improve even more focus read.
