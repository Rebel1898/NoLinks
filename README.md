> This add-on adds a button to the toolbar. Clicking on it activates the Reader View even if the icon in the address bar is not present.



## Description

This extension disables links and remove any kind of web interaction facilitating a link-free and clean read of a website.
According to "The Shallows" by Nicholas Carr, hyperlink texts and other interactive elements are one of the main factors that disrupts reading. Reading online activates different brain regions than book reading, and this is partly due to websites been saturated with interactive elements that impose unconscius decissions regarding clicking them or not. 

In order to mitigate this, this addon removes any interaction in the web displayed in tab (such as pointer events) and it presents links as plain text, improving readability. Moreover, this addon may launch when possible , the integrated Firefox reader view to improve even more focus read.


## Remark
This addon is still experimental and may not work as expected on certain sites. It would be appreciatted if any anomalous behaviour is reported.
